## Design and Responsiveness

Even before starting formal education in Software Engineering, the focus was on creating a responsive website. The webpage was designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring it looks great on cellphones and then adjusting for larger screens. The design features a thorough color palette using gray tones, white, and purple accent colors. The structure of the page is achieved through a combination of CSS Grid, relative, and absolute positioning. The webpage uses cards to highlight the different services offered by the business.
